 * This Distribution is intended to provide intentionally biased or unbiased sources of randomness for testing.
 * The biases are intended to allow control of likelihood of edge or near-edge cases in order to make overflows and
 * other unexpected behaviours more likely. The biases are intended to to be close but not exact approximations of the
 * defined distributions.
 * <p>
 * This class is currently thread safe because at core it uses the {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom} class
 * which removes any inter-dependencies. Overriding the seed is not supported and would make little sense in a multi-
 * threaded environment anyway. If generated values are needed for repeatable testing then they must be
 * stored independently after generation.
