    This package contains self-contained {@link com.robertboothby.djenni.distribution.Distribution} implementations that rely
    on {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom}. They prioritise readability and deterministic biasing over strict
    statistical accuracy, making them ideal for test data generation. Each primitive family (double, int, long) exposes
    uniform, normal, and inverted-normal curves to help emphasise edge cases. Should more sophisticated RNGs be needed,
    these implementations can be swapped for Apache Commons RNG or another engine without affecting caller code.
