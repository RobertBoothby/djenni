    This package contains implementations of {@link com.robertboothby.djenni.distribution.Distribution} that are based on simple forms
    of randomness and do not add complexity by being able to generate the full range of a given primitive type.

    TODO - Replace my naive implementations with the Apache Commons RNG implementations.
