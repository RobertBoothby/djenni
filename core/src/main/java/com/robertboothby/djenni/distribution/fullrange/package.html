<p>
    This package is reserved for distributions that can exhaustively generate a primitive’s full range. They typically do
    so by accepting a wider bound type (for example, expressing an <code>int</code> range in terms of a {@link Long}) so
    that overflows are avoided.
</p>
<p>
    For example when generating Integers, expressing the bound as an Integer only allows a bound of
    2147483647 which means that a naive Integer Distribution can only ever generate values with a range of 0 to 2147483646
    inclusive. This makes full range generation difficult as the full range of an Integer is -2147483648 to 2147483647 or
    as a positive number bound it is 4294967296 (0x100000000).
</p>
<p>
    So if we want to generate the full range we need to be able to express this bound in a type that can handle it. For
    Integers the type is as a Long.
