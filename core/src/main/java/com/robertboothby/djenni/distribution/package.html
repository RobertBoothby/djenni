    The <code>com.robertboothby.djenni.distribution</code> package defines the abstraction used by every supplier builder
    that needs randomness. The top-level {@link com.robertboothby.djenni.distribution.Distribution} interface formalises the
    contract of generating a number in <code>[0, bound)</code>, while subpackages provide concrete implementations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>simple</strong> &mdash; lightweight, thread-safe distributions backed by
        {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom}. These cover uniform, normal, inverted-normal and one-sided
        variants for doubles, integers, and longs.</li>
    <li><strong>fullrange</strong> &mdash; conceptual placeholder for distributions that can exhaustively traverse the
        range of a primitive by accepting wider bounds (e.g. using a {@link java.lang.Long} bound to produce full-range integers).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Builders mix-and-match these distributions to bias test data toward edge cases, bulk “happy path” values, or any
    other probability curve needed to uncover defects.
